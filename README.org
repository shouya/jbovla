* Dictionary

Abandonware notice:

I was trying build this macOS dictionary using developer kit in this project. The goal is to make a customized dictionary according to my preference. Turns out macOS dictionary is a bit less capable to fulfill my needs. So I gave this project up.

For alternation, you may want to look at:

- guskant's Lojban dictionary (https://guskant.github.io/lojbo/stardict.html): a very nice and comprehensive dictionary
- DictUnifier (https://github.com/jjgod/mac-dictionary-kit): you can use this tool to convert guskant's dictionary to macOS dictionary format
- gernytci (https://github.com/shouya/gernytci): I implement some of my ideas in this cli tool

** Build

You need to have [[https://deno.land/][deno]] installed to build the dictionary because the build script is written in deno-flavored JavaScript.

Run `make` to build the dictionary. Then run `make install` to install it to user dictionary directory.
